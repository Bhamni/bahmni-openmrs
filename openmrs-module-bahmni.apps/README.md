This repository simply bundles the bahmni-app client angular app by
cloning it into the webapp folder of the omod, thereby creating an
OpenMRS compatible omod structure. It also defines registration as an
app, and can thus be installed by the OpenMRS module interface and also
participate in the app icon drawing.
