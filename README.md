This is one pom module, that encapsulates all the Bahmni client apps
that need to be packaged as OpenMRS omods.

All Bahmni client apps like Registration, OPD etc. are cloned into their
specific pom based projects which can then be used inside OpenMRS. This
is the parent pom structure that pulls in all the clients.
